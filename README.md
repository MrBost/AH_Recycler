Non bio-degradable waste forms a major part of the waste generated in Lagos state (case study). Some of the problems with plastic bags, according to [a study][1], include:

1. Costly collection
2. Sorting is necessary and cost-intensive
3. Quality and cleanliness are critical issues and hard to maintain

We propose a system that turns everyday Lagosians into “environment activists” - have them collect re-usable plastic waste (bottles, bags) and drop them off at designated facilities. Bottles will be sent to recycling facilities (1), and bags will be cleaned (how?) and sold to environment-friendly companies (supermarkets, etc) for re-use.

Also, turn these activists into advocates - encourage them to educate and motivate others around them to become activists too. Some gamification might be involved :-)
