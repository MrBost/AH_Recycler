# AH_Recycler

Non bio-degradable waste forms a major part of the waste generated in Lagos state (case study). Set up a system that turns everyday Lagosians into “environment activists” - have them collect re-usable plastic waste (bottles, bags) and drop them off at designated facilities; these will be cleaned (how?) and sold to environment-friendly companies (supermarkets, etc) for re-use.

Also, turn these activists into advocates - help them educate and motivate others around them to become activists too.
