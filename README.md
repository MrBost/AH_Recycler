# AH_Recycler

Non bio-degradable waste forms a major part of the waste generated in Lagos state (case study). Some of the problems with plastic bags, according to [a study][1], include:

1. costly collection
2. sorting is necessary and cost-intensive
3. quality and cleanliness are critical issues and hard to maintain

We propose to set up a system that turns everyday Lagosians into “environment activists” - have them collect re-usable plastic waste (bottles, bags) and drop them off at designated facilities. Bottles will be sent to recycling facilities (1), and bags will be cleaned (how?) and sold to environment-friendly companies (supermarkets, etc...make list of these) for re-use.

Also, turn these activists into advocates - help them educate and motivate others around them to become activists too.
