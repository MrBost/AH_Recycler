The application will consist of:

1. A backend to provide the following functions:
   i. Resolve an address into a Lat/Lon using the Google Places API
   ii. Find drop-off locations within range of a Lat/Lon
   iii. Register a user (minimal information required - just a phone number, really)
   iv. Assign points to a user
   v. Return a user's current points
2. USSD and SMS interfaces to the backend
3. A Progressive Web App (PWA) to encourage users to become environmental advocates, 
   by having them adopt a cute mascot, and perform environment-friendly tasks, to care
   for the mascot. Periodically, we'll send out Push notifications to keep them engaged,
   and share information and tips for improving their environment.
